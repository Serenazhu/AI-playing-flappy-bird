Unlike traditional neural network training methods that rely on 
gradient-based optimization algorithms, NEAT employs an evolutionary 
approach instead. Each neural network is encoded as a genome. 
NEAT evolves populations of neural networks over generations. 
During evolution, it allows for the addition of new nodes and connections 
to the neural network architecture, enabling the algorithm to explore more 
complex structures over time.
